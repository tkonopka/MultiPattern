Description: Multi-pattern discovery is a task in exploratory data analysis. Similarly as in clustering, its goal is to identify patterns in data. However, whereas conventional clustering aims to output one clustering solution, a multi-pattern analysis is based on the idea that complex data may encode more than meaningful structure. Thus, a multi-pattern analysis aims to characterize more than one pattern and describe the relations between them. The MultiPattern package provides an interface to several pattern-finding algorithms and provides tools for performing cross-cutting meta-comparisons and visualizations.
