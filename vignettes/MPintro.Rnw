\section{Background}

The MultiPattern package provides a framework for unsupervised analysis of data. Its main premise is that a dataset may contain more than one underlying pattern or clustering. The goal of the package is to provide a means to discover multiple of these patterns during the course of an analysis. 

In this vignette, we will look at the package structure and apply the package to some small synthetic datasets.




\section{A sample multi-pattern analysis of a toy dataset}

Let's apply the framework to analyze a toy dataset. In this section, we will load the dataset, run a multi-pattern analysis, and interpret the results.




\subsection{Data preparation}

Let's begin by loading the package and fetching one of its datasets. For simplicity, let's use a small dataset called {\tt MPdata6S} and rename it {\tt D6}.

<<>>=
library("MultiPattern")
D6 = MPdata6S
head(MPdata6S, 3)
@

\noindent The first two columns contain coordinates. The third column contains expected class labels. The data can thus be visualized\footnotemark in its entirety (Figure \ref{fig:fig_D6}).

<<D6map, eval=FALSE>>=
MPplotmap(D6[,c("D1", "D2")])
MPplotmap(D6[,c("D1", "D2")], split(rownames(D6), D6[, "class"]))
@

<<fig_D6, echo=FALSE, out.width="0.4\\textwidth", out.height="0.2\\textwidth", fig.width=3, fig.height=1.5, fig.cap="Dataset {\\tt MPdata6S}: (left) raw data points arranged in two dimensions; (right) similar to previous panel, but with markers distinguishing the points' expected class.">>=
Rcsspar(mfrow=c(1,2))
<<D6map>>
@ 

\footnotetext{Here and in other cases that follow, visualizations are produced using customized functions defined within with the package using {\tt Rcssplot}. Note, however, that the visualizations can also be performed using other approaches, in this case using a simple scatter plot.}




\subsection{Analysis setup}

To set up a multi-pattern analysis, we create an object of class {\tt MultiPattern} using the command {\tt MPnew()}. This requires the names/identifiers for our observations and a list of datasets. 

<<>>=
mp6 = MPnew(rownames(D6), data=list("D6"=D6[,1:2]))
@

\noindent In this case, the list of datasets consists of only one data frame. Note that the command inputs only the numeric columns and omits the expected class labels.

We can check the initialization worked by printing a summary of the new object.

<<>>=
mp6
@

\noindent The last line of the output shows that we did not specify any clustering configurations for this multi-pattern analysis. 

Let's now update the {\tt mp6} object to reflect the type of analysis that we wish to perform. We can add analysis configurations using function {\tt MPsuggestConfig}. This requires access to the configuration object and the name of the target dataset.

<<>>=
mp6 = MPsuggestConfig(mp6, "D6")
@ 

\noindent This prints a short summary. The main changes are observed by printing an object summary again.

<<>>=
mp6
@ 

\noindent There are two important changes. First, we now have two datasets associated with the analysis. The new dataset is called ``D6.pca''. As the name suggests, it contains a principal-component decomposition of the original data. Second, we now have more than twenty analysis configurations. We can get a glimpse at them with the following command.

<<>>=
names(mp6$configs)[c(1:6)]  ## a selection of the configuration names
@

\noindent These names are not complete descriptions of the underlying analyses. However, they are nonetheless informative. For example, the name of the first configuration suggests it performs an analysis based on euclidean distance. The third analysis considers only the first principal component. Other configurations apply strategies based on a clustering approach. (More details of these analyses are outlined below in section \ref{sec:sec_details}.)

** To do ** Introduce meaningful groups of analyses 

<<>>=
config.names = names(mp6$configs)
config.groups = list("clust" = grep("clust", config.names, val=T),
                     "pca" = grep("PC", config.names, inv=T, val=T))
@




\subsection{Calculation}

Having configured our multi-pattern analysis, we can now run the actual calculation. This entails computing a meta-dissimilarity object. 

<<MP6metasims, cache=TRUE>>=
mp6.metasims = MPgetAverageMetaDistance(mp6)
@

\noindent The calculation uses a form of bootstrap averaging over several repetitions. Hence the warning about the waiting time. After the calculation completes, its result is a dissimilarity matrix.

<<>>=
mp6.metasims[1:4,1:2]  ## top-left corner of a larger matrix
@

The rows and columns are labeled by the configurations that we defined previously. Let's look at a few of the entries.

\begin{itemize}
\item The diagonal is zero by definition.
  
\item The entries at position $[2,1]$ and $[3,1]$ are non-zero (as are most other entries in the matrix). Their absolute values are uninformative, but their relative sizes are. The magnitudes suggest that (for this dataset) analyses based on euclidean and canberra distances are more similar than an analysis based on euclidean distance and an analysis that uses the first PC.
  
\item The entry at position $[4,1]$ is zero. This compares an analysis performed on the full dataset to another analysis based on the first two principal components of the dataset. In this example, the second dataset is a lossless rotation of the first. All euclidean distances in these two datasets are equivalent. Hence there is no difference between these analyses in this case. 
\end{itemize}




\subsection{Visualization}

As {\tt MP6metasims} is a dissimilarity matrix, we can use it to compute a MDS map.

<<MP6metamap, eval=TRUE>>=
mp6.metamap = MPgetMap(mp6.metasims)
@ 

\noindent We can then visualize the map as follows.

<<MP6plotmetamap1, eval=FALSE>>=
MPplotmap(mp6.metamap, col=config.groups, Rcssclass="meta")
MPplotmap(mp6.metamap, col=config.groups, Rcssclass="meta", label=TRUE)
@

\noindent The first command computes a multi-dimensional scaling map, adding some white noise to separate nearby points. The subsequent commands produce two graphical representations, adding styling to distinguish the random and the non-random configurations (Figure \ref{fig:fig_metamap}).


An important distinction between this visualization and common uses of MDS is that the dots in the visualization do not correspond to the elements in the original dataset. Rather, the dots represent complete analyses based on the dataset. They are scattered around the plot. This indicates that the individual analyses bring out distinct pattern from each other. The meta-dissimilarity visualization thus captures relations between various independent unsupervised analyses performed on the dataset. 




\subsection{Representative clustering methods}

Based on the computed meta-dissimilarities between dozens of analyses, we can select a smaller number of representative configurations. We can do this based on their positions in the MDS diagram. 

<<MP6reps>>=
mp6.reps = MPgetRepresentatives(dist(mp6.metamap), method="extreme", k=4)
mp6.reps = setNames(mp6.reps, LETTERS[1:length(mp6.reps)])
mp6.reps
@

The first command here requests {\tt k=6} representative configurations that appear well-separated in the MDS map. We can identify them in the MDS diagram (Figure \ref{fig:fig_metamap}).

<<MP6plotmetamap2, eval=FALSE>>=
MPplotmap(mp6.metamap, col=config.groups, highlight.points=sort(mp6.reps), 
          legend=FALSE, Rcssclass="meta")
@

<<fig_metamap, echo=FALSE, out.width="0.99\\textwidth", out.height="0.33\\textwidth", fig.width=5.4, fig.height=1.8, fig.cap="Multi-pattern map for the {\\tt MPdata6S} dataset: (left) an MDS representation of relationships between clustering analyses; (center) similar to previous panel, but with dots replaced by text labels; (right) similar to first panel, but with five representative configurations highlighted by darker and larger markers.">>=
Rcsspar(mfrow=c(1,3))
<<MP6plotmetamap1>>
<<MP6plotmetamap2>>   
@ 


\noindent From our initial set of analysis configurations, we now have a smaller number of approaches that might be interesting for follow-up. 




\subsection{Follow-up with traditional clustering}

Each of the four highlighted approaches is a stand-alone method for unsupervised analysis. We can therefore use these approaches to compute distances between the data points. 

<<MP6sims, cache=TRUE>>=
mp6.sims = MPgetDistances(mp6, configs=mp6.reps)
@

This step can also take a while to finish. The result is a list of {\tt dist} objects. We can peek at the matrix representation of the first element.

<<>>=
as.matrix(mp6.sims[[1]])[1:4,1:4]
@

The distances are now between the original observations in dataset {\tt D6}. This is a familiar setting and we can apply traditional clustering. 

Although there are approaches to identify an optimal number of clusters, $k$, (e.g. using silhouette widths), let's pretend that we are constrained to use $k=3$. We can now use each of the four similarity matrices to find partitions of the original data.

<<>>=
## helper function uses pam clustering to assign labels to each point
## each label is [prefix+integer]
library("cluster")
pamclusters = function(dd, prefix="A",  k=3) {
  dpam = pam(dd, k=k)
  setNames(paste0(prefix, dpam$clustering), names(dpam$clustering))
}
## create a matrix of labels associating each point to one label 
## per representative in mp6.reps and mp6.sims
mp6.clust = matrix(NA, ncol=length(mp6.reps), nrow=nrow(D6))
rownames(mp6.clust) = rownames(D6)
colnames(mp6.clust) = names(mp6.reps)
for (i in names(mp6.reps)) {
  temp = pamclusters(mp6.sims[[mp6.reps[i]]], prefix=i)
  mp6.clust[names(temp), i] = temp	
  rm(temp, i)
}
@

The above code block first defines a helper function that computes a {\tt pam} clustering and splits observations into $k=3$ groups. The remainder of the block creates a matrix {\tt MP6clust} and collects the cluster partitions for each of the similarity matrices in {\tt MP6reps}. A few rows of the result are as follows.

<<>>=
mp6.clust[c(1,2,13,25,37),]   ## a few of the rows in a larger matrix
@ 

\noindent Thus, each observation in the original dataset is now associated with a label by each of the configurations. These labels can also be displayed visually (Figure \ref{fig:fig_scatterK}).

<<D6K, eval=FALSE>>=
par(mfrow=c(1,4))
for (i in colnames(mp6.clust)) {
  MPplotScatterWithK(D6[,1:2], mp6.clust[,i], main=i, Rcssclass="scatter")
}
@

<<fig_scatterK, echo=FALSE, out.width="0.7\\textwidth", out.height="0.175\\textwidth", fig.width=6, fig.height=1.5, fig.cap="Three-color clusterings of dataset {\\tt MPdata6S}. Each panel shows the entire dataset with colors determined by {\\tt pam} clustering to distance matrices output by the representative approaches from the multi-pattern map (labeled A-D).">>=
<<D6K>>
@ 

\noindent Each diagram shows the dataset partitioned into black, red, and blue points according to different clustering analyses. The partitions are different, but we can see that each one has its own logic.

At this stage, the suggested partitions may seem imperfect, i.e. they may place some points in strange groups. The point here is not to critique such properties of individual algorithms. Rather, it is to acknowledge that the algorithms are informative in different ways.



\subsection{Multi-labeling}

Now that we have multiple labels for each data point, we can investigate combinations of these labels. 

<<MPmultilabels>>=
mp6.multilabels = apply(mp6.clust, 1, paste, collapse=".")
mp6.multilabs = sort(table(mp6.multilabels), decreasing=T)
mp6.multilabs
@

\noindent We see that the data points fall into many categories defined through the multi-label groups. Thus, we have a finer stratification of the data than from any single method. We can now visualize groups this stratification (Figure \ref{fig:fig_MLs}). 

<<plotMU, eval=FALSE>>=
par(mfrow=c(2,4))
for (uu in names(mp6.multilabs)[1:min(8, length(mp6.multilabs))]) {
  temp = mp6.multilabels
  temp[temp!=uu] = "other"
  MPplotScatterWithK(D6[,1:2], temp, main=uu, Rcssclass=c("scatter", "mu"))
}
@

<<fig_MLs, echo=FALSE, out.width="0.7\\textwidth", out.height="0.35\\textwidth", fig.width=6, fig.height=3, fig.cap="Multi-label groups for dataset {\\tt MPdata6S}. Each panel shows the entire dataset with a small number of points highlighted in red. Panels are identified by the name of the multi-label group and sorted in order of group size. ">>=
<<plotMU>>
@ 

\noindent We can draw several observations from these results.

\begin{itemize}
\item The most populous groups correspond to the expected six groups (c.f. Figure \ref{fig:fig_D6}). Thus, the multi-label approach achieves clustering into a reasonable number of bins even though we constrained the individual methods to $k=3$.
  
\item The multi-labels identify a few points that form groups on their own or with a small number of others. These are hard-to-cluster outliers that we might want to remove or analyze separately if necessary. The multi-label strategy thus provides more information than a traditional clustering output.

\item The multi-labels specify similarity relations between the groups, which can be informative in downstream analyses. For example, the isolated point in group {\tt A1.B1.C3.D2} has three labels in common with the large group {\tt A1.B1.C2.D2}. The multi-label information might in this case provide an incentive to merge the two groups.
\end{itemize}

This completes our first-pass multi-pattern analysis of the toy dataset. In summary, we started with a raw dataset, defined a multi-pattern analysis, ran many types of unsupervised analyses on the data, selected a small number of these analyses for follow-up, and used these representatives to assigned multi-labels to each observation in the original dataset. We saw that the resultant labels are informative and interpretable, both alone and in combination with other labels. Thus, the multi-pattern analysis leaves a solid foundation for futher downstream processing. 

Before turning to fine-tuning the multi-pattern analysis workflow, the next section shows results on other datasets.




\subsection{Other datasets}

In addition to {\tt MPdata6S}, the package also includes several other test datasets. The same procedure described in this can be applied to each of them. Let's have a quick look at the multi-label groups produced in some of these. 

<<MPintrofunction, echo=FALSE>>=
mpintro = function(dd, k=6) {
  mp = MPnew(rownames(dd), data=list("dd"=dd[,1:2]))
  ## speed up calculation with fewer random configs
  mp = MPchangeSettings(mp, list(num.random=15))
  mp = MPsuggestConfig(mp, "dd", verbose=FALSE)
  metasims = MPgetAverageMetaDistance(mp, verbose=FALSE)
  metamap = MPgetMap(metasims)
  ## get representatives
  mpreps = MPgetRepresentatives(dist(metamap), method="extreme", k=k)
  mpreps = grep("rnorm", mpreps, inv=T, val=T)
  mpreps = setNames(mpreps, LETTERS[1:length(mpreps)])
  mpsims = MPgetDistances(mp, configs=mpreps)
  ## get labels
  mpclust = matrix(NA, ncol=length(mpreps), nrow=nrow(dd))
  rownames(mpclust) = rownames(dd)
  colnames(mpclust) = names(mpreps)
  for (i in names(mpreps)) {
    temp = pamclusters(mpsims[[mpreps[i]]], prefix=i, k=3)
    mpclust[names(temp), i] = temp	
    rm(temp, i)
  }
  ## output all the data
  list(data=dd,
       metasims=metasims,
       metamap=metamap,
       mpreps=mpreps,
       sims=mpsims,
       mpclust=mpclust)  
}

## expects xx as a list as output by mpintro above
## plot multi-label groups
plotMLG = function(xx, k=8) {
  mpu = apply(xx$mpclust, 1, paste, collapse=".")
  mput = sort(table(mpu), decreasing=T)
  mput = names(mput[1:min(k, length(mput))])
  for (uu in mput) {
    temp = mpu
    temp[temp!=uu] = "other"
    MPplotScatterWithK(xx$data[,1:2], temp, main=uu, 
                       Rcssclass=c("scatter", "mu"))
  }
}
@

<<intros, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE>>=
## perform whole MP analysis for several datasets
mp3S = mpintro(MPdata3S);
mp9S = mpintro(MPdata9S)
@

Figure \ref{fig:fig_9S} shows results for a nine-group dataset. This is a rather simple dataset where the groups are well-separated. The multi-label groups thus result in near-perfect identification of the groups.

<<fig_9S, echo=FALSE, out.width="0.7\\textwidth", out.height="0.35\\textwidth", fig.width=6, fig.height=3, fig.cap="Multi-label groups obtained for dataset {\\tt MPdata9S}. Panels are ordered by group size.">>=
Rcsspar(mfrow=c(2,4))
plotMLG(mp9S)
@

Figure \ref{fig:fig_3S} shows results for a three-group dataset with more complex features. Two of the groups have non-convex shapes and are much larger than the third. This type of arrangement is known to cause trouble for many methods based on euclidean distance. While the multi-pattern workflow can be tuned to include approaches that are suitable for this type of data (see following section), the objective of the workflow is actually to identify several viewpoints. Thus, the workflow is bound to identify configurations that split the outer groups into parts. The end result is that the multi-label stage groups are much smaller and more numerous than the true groups. From a naive standpoint, therefore, the multi-pattern analysis `fails' to reveal the true structure.

However, the multi-pattern result is informative because it reveals relations between those group. For example, considering the three largest groups, we notice that {\tt A1.B2.C1.D1} is only two labels away from {\tt A2.B2.C1.D2} (which in the ideal case should be part of the same cluster) and four labels away from {\tt A3.B3.C2.D3} (which should be part of a different cluster). 

<<fig_3S, echo=FALSE, out.width="0.7\\textwidth", out.height="0.35\\textwidth", fig.width=6, fig.height=3, fig.cap="Multi-label groups obtained for dataset {\\tt MPdata3S}. Panels are ordered by group size.">>=
Rcsspar(mfrow=c(2,4))
plotMLG(mp3S)
@




\section{Customizing a multi-pattern analysis}

In the previous section, we carried out a `default' analysis of a toy dataset. But there are several ways of customizing the multi-pattern workflow. This section outlines how to adjust analysis settings, how to add or create configurations to the multi-pattern analysis, and how to tune the multi-pattern map. 




\subsection{Updating analysis settings}

An object of class {\tt MultiPattern} like {\tt MP6} is a list of multiple object types. Its {\tt settings} components contains various parameters and values that tune an analysis. Their values can be viewed as follows.

<<update1>>=
mp6$settings
@ 

\noindent The meanings of individual parameters are explained in the documentation.

<<update2, eval=FALSE>>=
help(MPdefaultSettings)
@ 

\noindent This should print a message outlining each setting component (omitted here for brevity). For example, {\tt subsample.R} determines the number of bootstrap repetitions performed by function {\tt MPgetAverageMetaDistance}. 

Values for analysis settings can be changed either using function {\tt MPchangeSettings} or via direct manipulation.

<<update3>>=
mp.temp = mp6
mp.temp$settings$subsample.R
mp.temp = MPchangeSettings(mp.temp, list(subsample.R=100))
mp.temp$settings$subsample.R
mp.temp$settings$subsample.R = 150
mp.temp$settings$subsample.R
@ 

\noindent The object {\tt mp.temp} is a scratch object. The rest of the block demonstrates two ways to change a setting value. The former has the advantage of providing a warning while attempting to modify a non-core settings.

<<update4>>=
mp.temp$settings$subsample.R
mp.temp = MPchangeSettings(mp.temp, list(sbsmpl.R=75))
mp.temp$settings[c("subsample.R", "sbsmpl.R")]
@ 

\noindent The warning on the second line appears by design. Note, however, that the parameter {\tt sbsmpl.R} is actually included into the settings despite the warning.




\subsection{Creating analysis configurations}

A core step of a multi-pattern analysis is defining a collection of configurations. Each configuration is a traditional approach to pattern analysis based on a distance or dissimilarity function. The package provides a factory function {\tt MPdistFactory} that creates appropriate distance functions. This factory can produce some straight-forward as well as some non-traditional functions. 

Let's see how to produce a configuration using the factory method. We can start by making a distance function based on euclidean distance.

<<addconf1>>=
dist.def = dist
dist.fac = MPdistFactory(method="euclidean")
## helper function - test that two functions produce same output on a dataset
identical.dist = function(f1, f2, data) {
  identical(as.numeric(f1(data)), as.numeric(f2(data)))
}
identical.dist(dist.def, dist.fac, D6[,1:2])
@ 

\noindent The first two lines create two distance functions, one using the default {\tt dist} and one using the factory. The helper function that follows tests whether the output of two functions are numerically equivalent on a dataset. The last line shows that the two distance functions produce equivalent results on {\tt D6}. We thus have {\tt dist.fac} produced by the factory that reproduces the behavior of {\tt dist}.

The function {\tt dist.fac} produced by the factory is relevant because it behaves differently with missing values.

<<addconf2>>=
D6na = D6[,1:2]
D6na[1,2] = D6na[3,1] = NA
head(D6na,4)
head(dist.def(D6na))
head(dist.fac(D6na))
@ 

\noindent The new dataset {\tt D6na} contains two {\tt NA}s. The default euclidean distance function carries these {\tt NA}s forward. The factory-produced method does not. Rather, it uses naive mean-based imputation to replace the missing values with averages from the dataset, and then computes the euclidean distances based on those imputed values. This behavior guarantees that the output is always {\tt NA}-free. 

Beside producing imputing distance functions, the factory can also produce other nonconventional distance functions. The documentation describes the complete set. One interesting feature is a distance function inspired by 'alternative clustering'.

<<addconf3>>=
dist.pam2alt = MPdistFactory(method="pam", clust.k=2, clust.alt=TRUE)
@ 

\noindent This distance function is inspired by the Coala algorithm \cite{bae2006coala}. It first clusters the dataset using {\tt pam} into 2 and 4 clusters, and determines how the four clusters are joined to make two. It then adjusts the data to induce an alternative merging. It returns a distance object that emphasize the alternative merging. To see this in action, we can perform a two-color clustering based on euclidean distance and on this `pam-alternative' distance (Figure \ref{fig:fig_regalt}).

<<addconf4, eval=FALSE>>=
D6.reglabs = pamclusters(dist.fac(D6[,1:2]), k=2)
D6.altlabs = pamclusters(dist.pam2alt(D6[,1:2]), k=2)
MPplotmap(D6[,1:2], split(names(D6.reglabs), D6.reglabs), Rcssclass="scatter")
MPplotmap(D6[,1:2], split(names(D6.altlabs), D6.altlabs), Rcssclass="scatter")
@

<<fig_regalt, echo=FALSE, out.width="0.4\\textwidth", out.height="0.2\\textwidth", fig.width=3, fig.height=1.5, fig.cap="Clustering of dataset {\\tt MPdata6S}: (left) pam-clustering into two groups based on euclidean distance; (right) pam-clustering into two groups based on an alternative distance.">>=
Rcsspar(mfrow=c(1,2))
<<addconf4>>
@ 

\noindent The first panel shows a partition into two groups which is deterministic, but arbitrary. The second panel shows an alternative partition, capturing the essence of multi-pattern discovery.




\subsection{Adding custom configurations}

To define a custom configuration, we therefore need to define a distance function. 

As an example, let's work with the {\tt D6} dataset and suppose we are interested in a euclidean-like distance function that does not allow distance to be too-small. We first implement such a custom function.

<<newconf1>>=
## function for a "regularized" euclidean distance
## x - input matrix
## p - regularization quantile (smaller distances will be regularized)
dist.reg = function(x, p=0.1) {
    ## get traditional euclidean distance
    xd = dist(x)    
    ## find regularization level and adjust xd
    xdreg = as.numeric(quantile(xd, p=p))
    xd[xd<xdreg] = xdreg
    ## output adjusted distance
    xd
}
class(dist.reg(D6[,1:2]))
@ 

\noindent The custom function takes a matrix as input and returns an object of class {\tt dist} as output. (The last command is a quick test that the function works, but you can test it more thoroughly with some examples; compare the output with a traditional call to {\tt dist}).

We can now use this function within a multi-pattern workflow. Let's begin from scratch with a new {\tt MultiPattern} object. 

<<newconf2, eval=TRUE>>=
mp6.custom = MPnew(rownames(D6), list("D6" = D6[,1:2]))
mp6.custom
@ 

\noindent Let's add some configurations to this object, one by one, using function {\tt MPaddConfig}. 

<<newconf3>>=
mp6.custom = MPaddConfig(mp6.custom, "euclidean", data="D6", dist.fun=dist.euclidean)
mp6.custom = MPaddConfig(mp6.custom, "canberra",  data="D6", dist.fun=dist.canberra)
mp6.custom = MPaddConfig(mp6.custom, "reg",       data="D6", dist.fun=dist.reg)
mp6.custom
@ 

\noindent Each of the {\tt MPaddConfig} lines lines adds one configuration to our analysis object. The second argument sets a name for the analysis; the third argument determines the target dataset, and the fourth determines the distance function. We can check the names of these configurations in the {\tt configs} component. 

<<newconf4>>=
names(mp6.custom$configs)
@ 

\noindent These are equivalent to the strings passed to {\tt MPaddConfig} above. Thus we now have a small but workable definition of a three-pattern analysis. So we can compute a meta-dissimilarity matrix. 

<<newconf5>>=
mp6.custom.meta = MPgetAverageMetaDistance(mp6.custom, verbose=FALSE)
mp6.custom.meta
@ 

\noindent The relative sizes of the dissimilarities indicate that the regularized version of euclidean distance is more similar to the euclidean distance than to the canberra distance. In principle, we could now visualize this relationship on a three-pattern map and obtain multi-label assignments for each datapoint. 




\subsection{Adding configuration families}

Adding one configuration at a time as in the previous section is useful, but there are situations when we might want to explore several related functions. To explore this, let's start again from scratch, this time using a dataset with additional columns.

<<family1>>=
D6b = data.frame(D6[,1:2], 
    D3=(D6[,1]/10)+(D6[,2]/8), 
    D4=(D6[,1]/6)-(D6[,2]/9))
mp6.fam = MPnew(rownames(D6), list("D6b"=D6b))
mp6.fam
@ 

\noindent The third and fourth columns are here a linear combination of the other two. The details are not important; the point is just that we now have more than two features. 

We can add a family of configurations using function {\tt MPeasyConfig}. This requires a specification of a family type. As an example, let's use the {\tt pca} family.

<<family2>>=
mp6.fam = MPeasyConfig(mp6.fam, data="D6b", type="pca")
mp6.fam
names(mp6.fam$configs)
@ 

\noindent This added one dataset and eight new configurations. These configurations use all use euclidean distances on subspaces of PCA-transformed data. Configurations ending with {\tt PCx} use just the $x^{th}$ component; {\tt PCy.PCz} use the subspace spanned by the $x^{th}$ and $y^{th}$ components; and {\tt D6b:PCv..PCw} use all the components between $v$ and $w$. The maximal PC component in this family is limited by a setting {\tt num.PCs}, so the family is always finite even when the dataset is of very high dimension. 

At this stage, we can now create a family of configurations using {\tt MPeasyConfig}. Let's now see how to define such a family of configurations. This is achieved by writing a new function with a specific call pattern. An example based on our regularized euclidean distance is as follows.

<<family3>>=
## a plugin function for use with MPeasyConfig
reg.MultiPatternPlugin = function(MP, data.name, config.prefix, 
                                  preprocess.prefix = "", preprocess = NULL) {
  ## closure construction to create dist.regularized with various cutoffs
  makeRegDist = function(q) {
    force(q)
    function(x) {
      dist.reg(x, q)
    }
  }    
  ## add a series of configuration, using one MPaddConfig at-a-time
  for (qq in seq(5, 25, by=5)) {
    MP = MPaddConfig(MP, 
                     paste0(config.prefix, data.name, ":reg", 
                            sprintf("%02d", qq)),
                     data.name=data.name, dist.fun=makeRegDist(qq/100))
  }        
  ## return the modified MP object
  MP
}
@ 

\noindent The arguments of the function must be as shown. The contents of the function is free, but the output must be a {\tt MultiPattern} object. In this function here, the first block is a factory function that creates custom distance functions with different regulation thresholds. The second block is a loop that performs five {\tt MPaddConfig} operations at thresholds from $0.05$ to $0.25$.

Given the {\tt MultiPatternPlugin} function, we can again use {\tt MPeasyConfig} to add a family of configurations based on regularized euclidean distance with various cutoffs. 

<<family4>>=
mp6.fam = MPeasyConfig(mp6.fam, data="D6b", type="reg")
mp6.fam
names(mp6.fam$configs)
@ 

\noindent This verifies that the first command adds five new configurations to our previous set. Their names all contain the string {\tt reg} and a number that suggests the regularization quantile. 






\subsection{Tuning the multi-pattern meta-map}

Just like dissimilarities between observations within a dataset can be calculated in many different ways, so can the meta-dissimilarities between configurations. The function {\tt MPgetAverageMetaDistance} uses provides a two-parameter parametrization via {\tt alpha} and {\tt beta}. 

Tuning these parameters can alter the numeric of the meta-dissimilarity matrices, and thereby affect the multi-pattern map and all downstream calculations. To explore the effects of such adjustments, we can repeat the meta-dissimilarity calculation for the toy example using {\tt MP6}.

<<alphas0, echo=FALSE>>=
mp6$settings$subsample.R = 15
@ 

<<alphas, cache=TRUE>>=
mp6.0 = MPgetAverageMetaDistance(mp6, verbose=FALSE, alpha=1, beta=2)
mp6.a = MPgetAverageMetaDistance(mp6, verbose=FALSE, alpha=0.25, beta=2)
mp6.b = MPgetAverageMetaDistance(mp6, verbose=FALSE, alpha=1, beta=1)
@ 

\noindent The meta-dissimilarity matrices computed in these ways can then be visualized in multi-pattern maps (Figure \ref{fig:fig_alphas}).

<<fig_alphas, echo=FALSE, out.width="0.99\\textwidth", out.height="0.33\\textwidth", fig.width=5.4, fig.height=1.8, fig.cap="Multi-patterns for dataset {\\tt MPdata6S}: (left, center, right) maps produced with different combinations of paramters {\\tt alpha} and {\\tt beta}.">>=
Rcsspar(mfrow=c(1,3))
temp.0 = MPgetMap(mp6.0)
temp.a = MPgetMap(mp6.a)
temp.b = MPgetMap(mp6.b)
MPplotmap(temp.0, col=config.groups, 
          main="mp6, alpha=1, beta=2", Rcssclass="meta")
MPplotmap(temp.a, col=config.groups, 
          main="mp6, alpha=0.25, beta=2", Rcssclass="meta")
MPplotmap(temp.b, col=config.groups, 
          main="mp6, alpha=1, beta=1", Rcssclass="meta")
@ 

Unfortunately, the choice of visualization seems to be a subjective step; there is not a clear means to argue a-priori whether one is more informative than any other. This subject thus remains open for further thought.
